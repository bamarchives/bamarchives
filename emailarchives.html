        Communication that may have once taken place through memos, phone calls, and meetings happens more frequently through quick, short-form messages. These exchanges document a significant history of activity occuring within BAM as well as your general social network of friendly and professional contacts (as an example, consider viewing your Gmail in <a href="https://immersion.media.mit.edu/">immersion.media.mit.edu</a>).

        While some people may organize their messages by folders, others prefer to use email as a personal search engine. However you choose to access your email, it's important to be aware of a few things:
      </p>

      <p class="aside">
        When you are hired at BAM, your contract states that the records you create on-site belong to the institution. In most cases, the content of your mailbox will not be saved but the <a href="archivalitems.html">records schedule</a> helps both you and the Archives to be informed about what will be collected. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="aside">
        Email takes up an astonishing amount of storage on our servers. In addition to being costly, building up data just isn't environmentally sustainable. I.T. now sets up most new accounts with automated deletion of messages 6 to 10 years after they are created. This is part of the transition to Office 365, as well as an overall effort to improve our records management for organization, legal, and environmental purposes. 
      </p>

      <p class="aside">
        Determining how to best organize your email is dependent on your role at the institution and your own personal way of referencing your sent and received mail.
