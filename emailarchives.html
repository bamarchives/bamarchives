      <p>
      Email has come to be much more than simply mail in digital form. Communication that may have once taken place through inter-office memos, phone calls, or meetings, happens more frequently through quick, short form messages. This creates a unique history of activity and documents a comprehensive social network of friendly and professional contacts (to see your network, consider viewing your Gmail in <a href="https://immersion.media.mit.edu/">immersion.media.mit.edu</a>).

      While some people may diligently organize their messages by folders, others prefer to use email as a personal search engine. However you choose to access your email, it's important to be aware of a few things:
      </p>

      <p class="aside">
        When you are hired at BAM, your contract states that the records you create on-site belong to the institution. In regards to email, BAM will never look at your messages while you are currently employed, unless there is a legal purpose for doing so. In most cases, the content of your mailbox will not be saved. The records schedule helps both you and the Archives to be informed about what will be collected. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="aside">
        Email takes up an astonishing amount of storage on our servers. In addition to being costly, building up data just isn't environmentally sustainable. This is why we have to work with IT to automate the deletion of mail over time. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Determining how to best organize your email is a dependent on your role at the institution and your own personal way of referencing your sent and received mail.

      <p>I.T. sets up new accounts with <u>automated deletion of messages 6 years after they are created</u>. This is part of the transition to Office 365, as well as an overall effort to improve our records management for organization, legal, and environmental purposes.</p>
      <p>In addition to providing an added layer of organization, using folders allows you to keep certain correspondence for custom periods of time.</p>
      <p>Folders may also automatically move messages that should be later moved to the archives, completing this work for you with minimal effort.</p>
