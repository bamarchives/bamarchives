      <h4>Collecting Email</h4>
      <p>
      BAM Hamm Archives actively collects email records as a source of significant information illustrating the history of the Institution. These exchanges provide invaluable insight into experiences and actions influencing the evolution of programming at BAM as well as shifts within the surrounding community.
      </p>

    <article class="page-content">
      <h4>Access</h4>
      <p>
      Email collected by the Archives is not currently available for research due to legal, financial, and technical limitations. Staff requiring access to information contained in email previously transferred to the Archives may submit a request. A copy will be obtained pending access restrictions outlined below.
      </p>
      <p><u>Level I</u><br>
      After material has been delivered to the Archives, records that were not originally made public are restricted for a period of 10 years to ensure the privacy of individuals and to protect the organizationâ€™s ability to conduct business. Once this period has passed, the Director of the Archives may with the approval of related authorities authorize internal access, or in response to an external request, provide a means of viewing records on-site. Public access will only be granted after approval and review.
      </p>
      <p><u>Level II</u><br>
      Records originally made public may be freely accessed after delivery to the Archives at the discretion of the Institution.

      <h4>Disposition</h4>
      <p>
      Disposal in the context of email records refers to the intentional destruction of messages based on the Records Retention Schedule, or otherwise, the manual extraction of specific records to move them out of desktop application into the custody of the Archives or a shared server space within the department.</p>
      <p>
      Office 365 allows for automated destruction of mail after assigned periods of time. For information concerning the disposition timelines set for your department, please refer to the Records Retention Schedule.

      <h4>Management</h4>
      <p><i>Rules</i><br>
      Setting custom rules can organize content into designated folders without interrupting your daily work. Consider establishing rules for routine messages which can be easily categorized, and often contain current news, leaving a short period of relevancy.</p>
